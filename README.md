# hts-trees

This is an example script for examining an HTS (http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/) tree in Python.
It assumes that you have already created a dotfile for the tree, using Heiga Zen's script, available here:  http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/hts-users/spool/2008/msg00157.html
The example finds the minimum depth at which a given label appears in the tree.
